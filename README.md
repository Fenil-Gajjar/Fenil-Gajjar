# Hi there, I'm Fenil Gajjar ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I am a final-year Computer Engineering student specializing in computer systems, cloud computing, and DevOps practices. I have gained hands-on proficiency through academic and self-driven projects in containerization, orchestration, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, GitOps workflows, observability and monitoring, and cloud security. I am eager to leverage my technical skills in DevOps, cloud, and AI-driven technologies to drive efficiency and innovation in dynamic team environments.

## Skills

**Cloud:** AWS (EC2, EBS, EFS, VPC, Lambda, Route53, ALB, S3, ECS, ECR, IAM, RDS, SSM, Cloudwatch, Elastic Beanstalk)

**Container Orchestration:** Docker & Kubernetes (EKS, KOPS), Helm

**Infrastructure as Code & Configuration Management:** Terraform, Ansible

**Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD

**Build & Artifact Management:** Maven, Nexus

**Scripting & Programming:** Bash, Python

**Security & Load balancing:** SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP, Nginx

**Basic Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

**Version Control:** Git & Github

## Projects

Here are some of my key projects:

### Migration and Re-architecture of Multi-Tier Java Application on AWS

- Migrated multi-tier Java application (Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache) to AWS via a two-phase approach.
- **Phase 1:** Architected high-availability architecture with ELB, Auto Scaling Groups, Route 53, security groups, S3-based CI/CD, and SSL termination, achieving 99.9% uptime.
- **Phase 2:** Re-architected using managed cloud services (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, ElastiCache, Amazon MQ), reducing operational overhead by 60%. Implemented CloudFront CDN, multi-AZ deployment, and automated Maven pipeline.

### Capstone Automated DevSecOps Workflow for Cloud-Native Deployment

- Orchestrated automated DevSecOps pipeline for Spring Boot application using Jenkins CI/CD, with integrated security scanning (Trivy), code quality analysis (SonarQube), and artifact management (Nexus).
- Provisioned AWS EKS infrastructure via Terraform, containerized with Docker, and implemented GitOps deployment with SSL/TLS and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, achieving shift-left security practices across the entire SDLC.

### GitOps-Based VProfile Cloud-Native Deployment

- Engineered automated GitOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS EKS for end-to-end infrastructure provisioning and application deployment.
- Implemented CI/CD workflow with Docker/ECR containerization, Helm charts, SonarCloud quality gates, and automated testing, reducing deployment time and ensuring zero-downtime releases.

### Additional Projects

- Executed multiple end-to-end DevOps projects across Java and MERN stacks, complemented by extensive tool- and platform-specific tasks beyond full projects. Applied advanced practices in cloud infrastructure, automation, security, and deployment pipelines, with all work thoroughly documented and showcased on GitHub.
