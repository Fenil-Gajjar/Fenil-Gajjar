## üí° Featured Projects

Here are some of the key projects where I've applied my skills to solve real-world challenges:

### 1. Migration and Re-architecture of Multi-Tier Java Application on AWS

-   **Description**: Migrated a complex multi-tier Java application to AWS, focusing on high availability and operational efficiency. This project involved a two-phase approach, initially setting up a robust architecture with ELB, Auto Scaling Groups, and Route 53, achieving 99.9% uptime. The second phase re-architected the application using managed AWS services like Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and ElastiCache, significantly reducing operational overhead.
-   **Key Technologies**: AWS (ELB, ASG, Route 53, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, ElastiCache, Amazon MQ, CloudFront), Java, Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache, Maven.
-   **GitHub Repository**: [AWS-Cloud-Lift_and_Shift_Project](https://github.com/Fenil-Gajjar/AWS_Cloud_Lift_and_Shift_Project)

### 2. Capstone Automated DevSecOps Workflow for Cloud-Native Deployment

-   **Description**: Orchestrated a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline for a Spring Boot application. This project integrated Jenkins CI/CD with security scanning (Trivy) and code quality analysis (SonarQube). Infrastructure was provisioned on AWS EKS using Terraform, and GitOps principles were applied for deployment with SSL/TLS and robust monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
-   **Key Technologies**: Jenkins, Trivy, SonarQube, Nexus, AWS EKS, Terraform, Docker, GitOps, Prometheus, Grafana, Spring Boot.
-   **GitHub Repository**: [capstone-devsecops-mega-project](https://github.com/Fenil-Gajjar/capstone-devsecops-mega-project)

### 3. GitOps-Based VProfile Cloud-Native Deployment

-   **Description**: Engineered an automated GitOps pipeline for end-to-end infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS EKS. This project focused on achieving zero-downtime releases through a streamlined CI/CD workflow, Docker/ECR containerization, Helm charts, and automated testing with SonarCloud quality gates.
-   **Key Technologies**: GitHub Actions, Terraform, AWS EKS, Docker, ECR, Helm, SonarCloud.
-   **GitHub Repository**: [vulnerama-devsecops-mega-project](https://github.com/Fenil-Gajjar/vulnerama-devsecops-mega-project)
