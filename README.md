## Projects

### Featured Projects

#### Migration and Re-architecture of Multi-Tier Java Application on AWS

Migrated a multi-tier Java application (Tomcat, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Memcache) to AWS using a two-phase approach. Phase 1 involved architecting a high-availability setup with ELB, Auto Scaling Groups, Route 53, security groups, S3-based CI/CD, and SSL termination, achieving 99.9% uptime. Phase 2 re-architected the application using managed cloud services (Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, ElastiCache, Amazon MQ), reducing operational overhead by 60%. Implemented CloudFront CDN, multi-AZ deployment, and an automated Maven pipeline.

#### Capstone Automated DevSecOps Workflow for Cloud-Native Deployment

Orchestrated an automated DevSecOps pipeline for a Spring Boot application using Jenkins CI/CD, with integrated security scanning (Trivy), code quality analysis (SonarQube), and artifact management (Nexus). Provisioned AWS EKS infrastructure via Terraform, containerized with Docker, and implemented GitOps deployment with SSL/TLS and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring, achieving shift-left security practices across the entire SDLC.

#### GitOps-Based VProfile Cloud-Native Deployment

Engineered an automated GitOps pipeline using GitHub Actions, Terraform, and AWS EKS for end-to-end infrastructure provisioning and application deployment. Implemented CI/CD workflow with Docker/ECR containerization, Helm charts, SonarCloud quality gates, and automated testing, reducing deployment time and ensuring zero-downtime releases.
